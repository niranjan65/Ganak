### Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:swastikom/Ganak.git


##  API Reference

The API for this application has been deployed using one of the most poppular existing Python framework known as **FastAPI**. The main operation of the API involves handeling the user related requests, authentication using JWT, routes related to the chatbot along with generating report of the any particular disease found and the nearest clinic from user's address.

Let's understand each routes of the API one by one.


#### 1. Routes related to user



The routes related to user involves mainly with the operations such as **Creating** a user in the database, **Read** the current user information. **Updating** the user information and **Deleting** the user. Beside the Creating route all the other routes are protected meaning that the only authenticated user can have the access of those routes.


| Route |  Description                |
| :--------  :------------------------- |
| `POST /user/create` | Create a user and returns newly created user id. |
| `GET /user/me` | Returns the complete information of the current authenticated user. |
| `GET /user/me/update` | Updates the current authenticated user. |
| `GET /user/me/delete` | Deletes the current authenticated user. |



#### 2. User Authentication Routes



This route helps to authenticate user. It takes the email of the user along with the password and then returns a JWT token for further communication with the protected routes.


| Route |  Description                |
| :--------  :------------------------- |
| `POST /token` | Returns JWT access token after successfull authentication. |


#### 3. Password Reset Routes


Suppose a user who exists in the database has and he forgets the password. At that time this password reset routes will come to rescue the situation.

But how will that work.

Well there will be two specific routes-



| Route |  Description                |
| :--------  :------------------------- |
| `POST /password_reset/request` | This will send an OTP to the email address of the user. |
| `POST /password_reset/verify` | This will verify the OTP and allow user to set new password. |

In this way we can securely help the user to update the password in a safe and secure way.

For this API to develop MongoDB database has been used which is a non-sql database. The password and other sensitive informations are stored in the database in hash form or encrypted form. Which makes the data retrival and processing more secure for the user.


## Langchain Usage

1. Setting Up:

Import Libraries: The code starts by importing necessary libraries: os for environment variables and google.generativeai (genai) to interact with the Gemini API.

2. Function for Reusability (ask_gemini):

The code defines a function called ask_gemini that takes a prompt (the question you want to ask Gemini) as input. This function encapsulates the logic for configuring Gemini and getting a response.

3. API Key Retrieval:

Inside ask_gemini, it retrieves the API key from the environment variable named "GEMINI_API_KEY" using os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY").
It checks if the API key is set. If not, it raises an error to prevent unexpected behavior.

4. Configuring Gemini:

Once the API key is retrieved, it configures the Gemini model using genai.configure(api_key=api_key). This provides access to Gemini's capabilities.

5. Model Creation and Settings (generation_config):

A dictionary named generation_config is defined. This specifies parameters for how Gemini generates responses, including:

temperature: Controls randomness in the response (1 is balanced).
top_p: Focuses generation on the most likely words (0.95 is high focus).
top_k: Considers the top k most likely words at each step (64 is a moderate value).
max_output_tokens: Limits the maximum number of words in the response (8192 is quite large).
response_mime_type: Sets the response format as plain text.
The GenerativeModel object is created using genai.GenerativeModel. It takes three arguments:

model_name: Specifies the Gemini model version ("gemini-1.5-flash" in this case).
generation_config: The dictionary defined earlier to control response generation.
safety_settings (commented out): Here you could set specific safety parameters to guide response content, but it's left out in this example.

6. Starting a Chat Session:

model.start_chat initiates a conversation with Gemini. It provides some context (history) to guide the model's understanding.

The history is a list containing two dictionaries, each representing a conversation turn:
First turn (user): The user asks "Who is swastik".
Second turn (model): Gemini provides a response asking for clarification due to the ambiguity of "Swastik".

7. Sending Your Question and Getting Response:

The prompt argument provided to the ask_gemini function is used with chat_session.send_message to send your question to the ongoing chat session with Gemini.

The response from Gemini is received as a message object, and its text is extracted and returned by the function.

Overall, the code utilizes Gemini as a large language model to answer your question based on the provided prompt and the context established in the chat history.

## Usage/Examples

### Interaction between client and chatbot
1.) User: "I feel like pulling my hair right now."

=> Chatbot: "I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Let's try a deep breathing exercise together. Inhale slowly for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and then exhale slowly for 4 seconds. Repeat this a few times and let me know how you feel."

2.) User: "I tried it, but I still feel the urge."

=> Chatbot: "That's okay. Sometimes it takes a bit more time. How about we try a different approach? Can you grab a stress ball or another fidget toy to keep your hands busy? Or maybe you can try doodling or writing down your feelings."
